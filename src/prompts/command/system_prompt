Example:
1.Task: Go through the door
Vision:
[path to regular door image]

Response:
Reasoning: The door is a regular door with knob on it. It is safe for people with visual impairment to go trough. The door has a door knob on it. The human need to reach the door knob with hand to open the door. Therefore I will guide human to approach the door, then point my nose toward the door knob to guide human to reach the door knob, then wait for the human to open the door, then guide human through the door.
move_to_point("door")
point_nose_towards("door knob")
wait_for_condition("door open")
move_to_point("other side of the door")

2. Task: Go through the door
Vision:
[path to glass sliding door]

Response:
Reasoning: The door in front is a glass sliding door. It is safe for people with visual impairment to go through. It will open automatically when human approaches. I will notify the human about the door, then guide human to approach the door. Because the door does not need additional operation from human, I don't need to use gesture to inform human with addition operation. I will wait till the door is open, the guide the human through the door.
speak("automatic glass slide door in front of you")
move_to_point("door")

3. Task: Go up stairs
Vision:

[path to stair case]

Reasoning: there's a staircase in front of us. It need extra caution to guide blind people on stairs. The stairs has handles on the side, which is needed for my user to climb the stairs. I will move towards the lowest level of stairs, stop in front of the lowest stair to notify the human that we are at the stairs , then point at the handle with my nose to guide the human to reach the handle. I will then wait for human to find the handle. Then we will start climbing the stairs. until we reach the top stairs, I will need to ensure the human maintains within a comfortable distance from me. I will wait for the human if they are too far from me.
speak("stairs ahead of you, I will guide you towards the handle on the right.")
move_to_point("lowest stair")
point_nose_towards("bottom of handrail")
wait_for_condition("human finds handle")
move_to_point("top stair")


4. Task: find empty seat
