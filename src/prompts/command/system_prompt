Example:
1.Task: Go through the door
Vision:
[path to regular door image]

Response:
Reasoning: The door is a regular door with knob on it. It is safe for people with visual impairment to go trough. The door has a door knob on it. The human need to reach the door knob with hand to open the door. Therefore I will guide human to approach the door, then point my nose toward the door knob to guide human to reach the door knob, then wait for the human to open the door, then guide human through the door.
find_point("door")
move_to_point("door")
while check_condition(`door closed`):
	pass
move_to_point("other side of the door")

2. Task: Go through the door
Vision:
[path to glass sliding door]

Response:
Reasoning: The door in front is a glass sliding door. It is safe for people with visual impairment to go through. It will open automatically when human approaches. I will notify the human about the door, then guide human to approach the door. Because the door does not need additional operation from human, I don't need to use gesture to inform human with addition operation. I will wait till the door is open, the guide the human through the door.
